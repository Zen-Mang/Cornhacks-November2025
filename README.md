## Angry Bananas
This game is inspired by a semi-popular mobile
game that's commonly known as "Angry Birds" but with a twist: instead of birds, you launch bananas!


### How to Play
1. **Objective**: The goal is to knock down all the structures and eliminate the monkeys using a limited number of bananas.
2. **Controls**:
   - Click and drag the banana to set the launch angle and power.
   - Release the mouse button to launch the banana.
   - Use the spacebar to reset the banana if you want to try again.
   - Press 'R' to restart the level.
   - Press 'N' to skip to the next level.
   - Press 'P' to go back to the previous level.
   - Press 'M' to mute/unmute the sound.
   - Press 'Q' to quit the game.
   - Press 'Esc' to pause the game.

3. **Levels**: There are multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Each level has different structures and monkey placements.
4. **Scoring**: You earn points based on the number of monkeys eliminated and the number of bananas used. Try to complete levels with as few bananas as possible for a higher score!
